      JavaScript Question Answer
    </h1>

    <h2 class="my-4 fw-bold">
      1. Difference Between var, let, and const in JavaScript
    </h2>
    <p class="text-muted fs-5">
      In the early days of JavaScript, there was only one way to declare
      variables and that was using the var keyword. However, there were some
      issues associated with variables declared using the var keyword so it was
      necessary to evolve new ways for variable declaration. With the advent of
      ES6, now developers are able to define variables according to their
      specific needs, thanks to two new keywords: let and const. All three of
      these three keywords have similarities in their syntax for declaring
      variables. However, they differ in their usage and scope, as detailed in
      the next section. The differences between var, let, and const variable
      declaration in JavaScript include: Variables declared with var and const
      are scoped to the immediate function body. Variables declared with the var
      keyword are hoisted. Hoisting means that the variable can be accessed in
      their enclosing scope even before they are declared. Variables declared
      with the let keyword are block-scoped, which means the variables will have
      scope to the immediate enclosing block. Let us now discuss, in detail, how
      these keywords can make a developerâ€™s code more efficient and how to use
      each keyword to declare variables in JavaScript programs.

      2.Differences Between Arrow and Regular Functions
    </h2>
    <p class="text-muted fs-5">
      While both the regular and arrow syntaxes define functions, when would you
      choose one instead of another? That's a good question. In this post, I'll
      show the main differences between the two, so you could choose the right
      syntax for your needs. Inside of a regular JavaScript function, this value
      (aka the execution context) is dynamic. The dynamic context means that the
      value of this depends on how the function is invoked. In JavaScript, there
      are 4 ways you can invoke a regular function.

      3..forEach(), .map(), .filter(). What's the difference?
    </h2>
    <p class="text-muted fs-5">
      .forEach(), is used to execute the same code on every element in an array
      but does not change the array and it returns undefined. .map() executes
      the same code on every element in an array and returns a new array with
      the updated elements. .filter() checks every element in an array to see if
      it meets a certain criteria and returns a new array with the elements that
      return truthy for the criteria.
